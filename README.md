# Odin Recipes 

## This project is part of the **Foundations Path** of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The goal was to build a basic recipe website using only **HTML** to demonstrate mastery of essential web structure and semantic tags.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## These are some of the project’s key features:
- **Semantic HTML5:** Proper use of headings, lists, and sections.
- **Internal Linking:** Seamless navigation between the main page and individual recipe pages.
- **Image Integration:** Correct implementation of images with descriptive `alt` attributes.
- **File Organization:** Clear and logical directory structure for easy maintenance.
